My notebook had a big noise when I run some applications. At first, I guess there was some problems in the CPU fan. 
But it seems not. After cleaning some dirts, noises could not stopped. I relized that the sound came from the hard disk. 
Then checked it by application, it seemed fine.

Reviewed what I had did before the problem came, too many applications? The hard disk was too full to run my programs. 
I uninstalled some applications I did not use often, in order to release some spaces. God bless, hope it would help.
