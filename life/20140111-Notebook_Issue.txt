My notebook had a big noise when run some applications. At first, I guess there was some problem of the CPU fan. 
But it seems not. After cleaning some dirts, noises could not stopped. The sound came from the hard disk. Then checked
by application, it seemed fine.

Reviewed what I had did before the problem came, the hard disk was too full to run my programs. I uninstalled some 
applications I did not use often, to release some space. God bless, hope it would help.
