**NOTES: Sources from [Boston Dynamics](http://www.bostondynamics.com/)**

[Boston Dynamics](http://www.bostondynamics.com/), which was founded in 1992
by Marc Raibert and his colleagues, developed the robots with sensor-based controls
and computation to unlock the capabilities of complex mechanisms, that ran and maneuvered
like animals with remarkable behaviours: mobility, agility, dexterity and speed.

Let's take a tour of its robot family.

## 1. Animal-like Robots

### 1.1. LS3

- **Since**: 2012

- **Application**: A rough-terrain robot, designed to go anywhere Marines and Soldiers go on foot, helping carry their loads.

- **Technologies**: Each LS3 carries up to 400 lbs of gear and enough fuel for a 20-mile mission lasting 24 hours. It also travels to designated locations using terrain sensing and GPS.

- **Partners**: Funded by DARPA and the US Marine Corps, mengineers and scientists from Boston Dynamics, Carnegie Mellon, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Bell Helicopter, AAI Corporation and Woodward HRT.



### 1.2. Cheetah / WildCat

- **Since**: 2013 (WildCat)

- **Application**: The fastest legged robot in the world, a new land speed record for legged robots.

- **Technologies**: An articulated back that flexes back and forth on each step, increasing
its stride and running speed, much like the animal does. Cheetah runs on a high-speed treadmill
in the laboratory where it is powered by an off-board hydraulic pump and uses a boom-like
device to keep it running in the center of the treadmill. Wildcat is designed to operate untethered.

- **Partners**: Funded by DARPA's Maximum Mobility and Manipulation program.


### 1.3. BigDog

- **Since**: Unknown

- **Application**: A rough-terrain robot that walks, runs, climbs and carries heavy loads.

- **Technologies**: Powered by an engine that drives a hydraulic actuation system, with 4 legs that are articulated like an animal's, with compliant elements to absorb shock and recycle energy from one step to the next, with size of a large dog or small mule, about 3 feet long, 2.5 feet tall and weighs 240 lbs. BigDog's on-board computer controls locomotion, process sensors
and handles communications with the user. BigDog's control system keeps it balanced, manages
locomotion on a wide variety of terrains and does navigation. Sensors for locomotion include
ijoint position, joint force, group contact, ground load, a gyroscope, LIDAR and a stereo vision system. Other sensors focus on the internal state of BigDog, monitoring the hydraulic pressure, oil temperature, engine functions, battery charge and others. BigDog runs at 4 mph, climbs
slopes up to 35 degrees, walks across rubble, climbs muddy hiking trails, walks in snow and
water, and carries 340 lb load.

- **Partners**: Development of the original BigDog was funded by DARPA. Work to add manipulator and dynamic manipulation was funded by the Army Research Laboratory's RCTA program.



### 1.4. LittleDog

- **Since**: Unknown

- **Application**: A quadruped robot designed for research on learning locomotion. Scientists
at leading institutions use LittleDog to probe the fundamental relationships among motor
learning, dynmaic control, perception of the environment, and rough-terrain locomotion.

- **Technologies**: LittleDog has four legs, each powered by three electric motors. The legs
have a large range of motion. The robot is strong enough for climbing and dynamic locomotion
gaits. The onboard PC-level computer does sensing, actuator control and communications.
Control programs access the robot through the Boston Dynmaics Robot API. Onboard lithium
polymer batteries allow for 30 minutes to continuous operation without reacharging. Wireless
communications and data logging support remote operation and data analysis.

- **Partners**: LittleDog is used at MIT, Standford, Carnegie Mellon, USC, Univ. Pennsylvania and IHMC as part of a DARPA-funded program on advanced robotics (DARPA Information on
Processing Technology Office). 


### 1.5. SandFlea

- **Since**: Unknown

- **Application**: An 11 pound robot that drives like an RC car on flat terrain, but can
jump 30 ft into the air to overcome obstacles. That is high enough to jump over a compound
wall, onto the roof of a house, up a set of stairs or into a second story window.

- **Technologies**: The robot uses gyro stabilization to stay level during flight, to provide
a clear view from the onboard camera, and to ensure a smooth landing. Sand Flea can jump
about 25 times on one charge.

- **Partners**: Funded by the US Army's Rapid Equipping Force (REF). Earlier versions were
developed by Sandia National Laboratory with funding from DARPA and JIEDDO.



### 1.6. RHex

Source: Boston Dynamics Official Site

- **Since**: Unknown

- **Application**: A six-legged robot with inherently high mobility. Powerful, independently
controlled legs produce specialized gaits that devour rought terrain with minimal operator
input. RHex climbs in rock fields, mud, sand, vegetation, railroad tracks, telephone poles
and up slopes and stairways.

- **Technologies**: RHex has a sealed body, making it fully operational in wet weather,
muddy and swampy conditions. RHex's remarkable terrain capabilities have been validated
in government-run independent testing. RHex is controlled remotely from an operator control
unit at distances up to 700 meters. Visible/IR cameras and illuminators provide front and
rear views from the robot.

- **Partners**: Unknown


### 1.7. RiSE

- **Since**: Unknown

- **Application**: A rough-terrain robot that climbs vertical terrain such as walls, trees
and fences. RiSE uses feet with micro-claws to climb on textured surfaces. RiSE changes
posture to conform to the curvature of the climbing surface and its tail helps RiSE balance
on steep ascents.

- **Technologies**: RiSE is 0.25 m long, weights 2 kg, and travels 0.3 m/s. Each of RiSE's
six legs is powered by a pair of electric motors. An onboard computer controls leg motion,
manages communications, and services a variety of sensors, including joint position sensors,
leg strain sensors and foot contact sensors.

- **Partners**: Boston Dynamics devleoped RiSE in conjunction with researchers at University
of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and Lewis and Clark University.
RiSE was funded by DARPA.



## 2. Humanoid Robots 

### 2.1. Altas

Source: Boston Dynamics Official Site


- **Since**: 2013

- **Application**: A high mobility, humanoid robot designed to negotiate outdoor, rough
terrain. Atlas can walk biipedally leaving the upper limbs free to lift, carry, and manipulate
the environment. In extremely challenging terrain, Atlas is strong and coordinated enough
to climb using hands and feet, to pick its way through congested spaces.

- **Technologies**: Articulated, sensate hands will enable Atlas to use tools designed for
human use. Atlas includes 28 hydraulically-actuated degrees of freedom, two hands, arms,
legs, feet and a torso. An articulated sensor head includes stereo cameras and a laser range
finder. Atlas is powered from an off-board, electric power supply via a flexible tether.

- **Partners**: Several copies of the Atlas robt are being provided as Government Furnished
Equipment for the DARPA Robotics Challenge program with delivery scheduled in the sumer of 2013.

### 2.2. Petman

- **Since**: Unknown

- **Application**: An anthropomorphic robot designed for testing chemical protection clothing.
Natural agile movement is essential for Petman to simulate how a soldier stresses protective
clothing under realistic conditions.

- **Technologies**: Unlike previous suit testers that had a limited repertoire of motion and
had to be supported mechanically, Petman balances itself and moves freely; walking, bending
and doing a variety of suit-stressing calisthenics during exposure to chemical warfare agents.
Petman also simulates human pyhsiology within the proective suit by controlling temperature,
humidity and sweating, all to provide realistic test conditions.

- **Partners**: The Petman system was delivered to the user's test facility where it is
going through validation experiments. Boston Dynamics' partners for the program are
MRIGlobal, Measurement Technologies Northwest, Smith Carter CUH2A (SCC), SRD, and HHI
Corporation.
