# Feature Selection

### 1. Methods

- filter: independent test for each individual feature (information entropy/ statistical dependence test)
- wrapper: machine learning algorithm (decision tree/ SVM)
- hybrid approaches: combining the advantages of filter and wrapper
- Forward selection: empty feature to start, and one by one
- Backward elimination: all features to start, reduce one by one
