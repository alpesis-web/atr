# Map Experience

## 1. Designing HERE

map experience - unified, accessible, effortless
- promote single cloud account with state sharing across devices

mapping - providing beautifully relevant answers to everyday questions
LiveSight
- (help you) discover shops within a mall
- (tell you) what time a bus is due
- (show you) where to eat with the real world

location - such a personal thing - strategy
- "Where am I?" - where you are
- "How do I get to..?" - your geographical location in the world
- "Where's the nearest..?" - the places that are meaningful to your circle of friends

considering the needs of real people
- observe, prototype, test ideas directly

## 2. Contextually Aware

HERE - deep personalization - location as a platform - increasingly provide the right map at the moment you need it 
- back end: learn about behaviours and patterns - data crunching and predictive analytics
- front end: seamless and simple

Foresee - an actual model of the real world
- location services - more personal and social
- mapping technology - even more accessible

Model - antural guidance
- when you ask the question of where, you can see where you are accessing an accurate 3D representation of the world with fully clickable elements that can be explored more deeply
- Navigate with what you see around you as opposed to just relying on street names
