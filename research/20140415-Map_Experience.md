# Map Experience

## 1. Designing HERE

map experience - unified, accessible, effortless
- promote single cloud account with state sharing across devices

mapping - providing beautifully relevant answers to everyday questions
LiveSight
- (help you) discover shops within a mall
- (tell you) what time a bus is due
- (show you) where to eat with the real world

location - such a personal thing - strategy
- "Where am I?" - where you are
- "How do I get to..?" - your geographical location in the world
- "Where's the nearest..?" - the places that are meaningful to your circle of friends

considering the needs of real people
- observe, prototype, test ideas directly

## 2. Contextually Aware

HERE - deep personalization - location as a platform - increasingly provide the right map at the moment you need it 
- back end: learn about behaviours and patterns - data crunching and predictive analytics
- front end: seamless and simple
