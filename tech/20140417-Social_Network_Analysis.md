## 1. A Social Network Magic Trick

### eulerian path

applications
- seven bridges
- one stroke

even nodes must have an eulerian path
- node:
- path: 
- degree: odd/even

eulerian path  
eulerian tour  

## 2. Growth Rates in Social Networks

- nodes/vertices
- edges/links

|         | chain network | ring network | grid network   |
|:--------|:--------------|:-------------|:---------------|
| nodes/n | n             | n            | n              |
| edges/m | n-1           | n            | 2n - 2*sqrt(n) |
| cycles  |               |              | 2*edges        |
