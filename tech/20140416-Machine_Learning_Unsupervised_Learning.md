## 1. Randomized Optimization

Space X, f(x)max = maxF(x)  

find the best:
- factory, chemical, process control
- route finding
- root finding
- neural network
- decision tree

solutions:
- generate 8 test: small input space, complex function
- calculus: function has derivative, soluable = 0
- Newton's Method: function has derivative, iterately, single optima

Hard:
- big input space
- complex function
- no derivative (or hard to find)
- possibly many small optima
