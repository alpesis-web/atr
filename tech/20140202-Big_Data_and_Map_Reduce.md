# Big Data and Map Reduce

MapReduce: a framework for distributed computing

Summary  
Pros: Processes a massive job in a short period of time  
Cons: Algorithms must be rewritten; requires understanding of systems engineering  
Data: Numeric values, nominal values  

Machine Learning Algorithms for MapReduce  
- Naive Bayes
  * mapper: results of the probability of a feature
  * reducer: sum up results
  
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  * tree: to narrow search for cloest vectors
  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  * Pegasos algorithm: stochastic gradient descent
  
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
  * Lanczos algorithm: find the singular values in a large matrix
  
- k-means Clustering
  * Canopy clustering
