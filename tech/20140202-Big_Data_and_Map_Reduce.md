# Big Data and Map Reduce

MapReduce: a framework for distributed computing

Summary  
Pros: Processes a massive job in a short period of time  
Cons: Algorithms must be rewritten; requires understanding of systems engineering  
Data: Numeric values, nominal values  

Machine Learning Algorithms for MapReduce  
- Naive Bayes
  * mapper: results of the probability of a feature
  * reducer: sum up results
- k-Nearest Neighbors
