# Optimizing Models

### 1. Classification

- to find better more representative features
- to remove redundant and outliers
- to try a different classifier

### 2. NLP

- to find more rules and better ontology


### 3. Algebraic Expression

- to change the coeffieients (parameters, constants)
- to apply heuristic techniques (Genetic Algorithm (GA, Tabu search) to fine tune the values of constants

### 4. Black Box Models (such as Neural Networks)

- to change the parameters of the model (learning rate, training algorithm etc)


### 5. Models for Imbalanced Data-set

- over-sampling
- ensemble methods (multiple learning methods)
