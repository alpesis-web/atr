# Notebook Issue

My notebook had a big noise when I run some applications. At first, I guess there was some problems in the CPU fan. But it seems not. After cleaning some dirts, noises could not stopped. I relized that the sound came from the hard disk. Then checked it by application, it seemed fine.

Reviewed what I had did before the problem came, too many applications? The hard disk was too full to run my programs. I uninstalled some applications I did not use often, in order to release some spaces. God bless, hope it would help.

# Notebook Issue II

Today, I checked my disk by HD Tune, one block was damaged. I guessed this was because I shut down the power in an abnormal way yesterday. I tried to take this block out of the normal ones and ghost my system again.

Disk Genius:  
- formatting drives C and D
- releasing and then turnning this space to be primary


Ghost System:
- ghost by manual
- local -> partial -> from images
- choose the **.gho file
- choose the local drive (system drive)
- ghost

But, the most importance, is to back up my data. Since the problem locates in hard disk, I am wondering the hard disk is going to be broken. My data could not be save from on.
